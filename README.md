# Detection of Localized Manifolds Using NEURIPS22 Paper Abstracts 
 
Using the Cohere Dashboard at https://dashboard.cohere.ai/playground/embed, a sample of 33 NEURIPS22 accepted papers (title + abstract) were extracted, along with the code to compute the embeddings (using their trial API key). 

- Shape = (33, 4096)
- min,max,mean,std = -10.07, 9.16, -0.00, 1.29
